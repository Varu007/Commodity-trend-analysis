# Commodity-trend-analysis
This project uses Python and Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`) to pull historical commodity prices (Gold and Crude Oil), visualize their trends, and compare their normalized price movements over the past year.

## Tools Used
- Python
- yfinance
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ What It Does
- Pulls historical price data for Gold (`GC=F`) and Crude Oil (`CL=F`)
- Normalizes the prices for visual comparison
- Plots time-series charts to visualize relative trends

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

## Visualizations
- Line chart of Gold price trend
- Gold vs Crude oil price comparison
- Normalized price movement

## Insights
Gold was more stable during global macro uncertainty, while oil showed higher volatility due to geopolitical events and OPEC+ decisions.
